# 🦜 LangChain & LangGraph  

::left::

### LangChain

A framework for building applications powered by LLMs. 

* 🧠 Multiple LLM providers
* 📦 Document and vector stores
* 🛠️ External tools and APIs

::right::

### LangGraph

A framework for building complex, stateful AI agent workflows with advanced orchestration.

- 🗃️ **State management** - Persistent memory across steps
- 🔵 **Nodes** - Workflow components
- ➡️ **Edges** - Conditional logic

::bottom::

Both are frameworks for Python, but there are equivalents for JavaScript / TypeScript (**LangChain.js**) and Java (**LangChain4j**).
